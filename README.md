# Difff - GitHub-like Git Diff Viewer

This local fork fixes clipped long lines and displays untracked file contents in Working Directory Changes. Lines wrap automatically, including long strings without spaces. Untracked text files appear as additions without staging them; empty and binary files show explicit messages. The extension ID stays `knsh14.difff` so installing this build updates the existing extension and preserves its saved comments.

To build and install this fork with Node.js 22 or newer:

```sh
npm ci
npm run package
code --install-extension difff-1.0.1.vsix --force
```

Run `npm exec playwright install chromium` once, then `npm test` for Git integration and browser layout tests. To use an installed Chrome or Edge instead, set `DIFFF_BROWSER_CHANNEL` to `chrome` or `msedge` when running the tests. After installing the VSIX, run **Developer: Reload Window** in VS Code and reopen the diff.

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides a GitHub-like interface for viewing git diffs with branch/tag/commit selection.

## Features

### Dual Operation Modes

- **Branch Comparison Mode**: Compare any two git references (branches, tags, or commits)

- **Thread Management**: Click thread headers to expand/collapse entire comment discussions

### Comment Explorer Panel

- **Centralized Management**: Dedicated "Comments" panel in the activity bar sidebar
- **Organized View**: Comments grouped by file and diff context (base → compare)
- **Jump Navigation**: Click any comment to automatically navigate to its location in the diff
- **Batch Operations**: Remove all comments for specific file/branch combinations at once
- **Refresh Control**: Manual refresh button to sync comment display

### Advanced Features

- **Context Awareness**: Comments tied to specific files, lines, diff contexts, and git references
- **Export Functionality**: Copy all comments to clipboard in readable format for sharing
- **Persistent Storage**: Comments saved in VS Code workspace storage, persist across sessions
- **Multi-Mode Support**: Comments work in both Branch Comparison and Working Directory modes
- **User Integration**: Automatically detects and uses your Git username for attribution

### Comment Management Workflow

1. **Browse Comments**: Use the Comments panel to see all your annotations across different comparisons
2. **Quick Navigation**: Click any comment in the explorer to jump directly to its diff location
3. **Bulk Cleanup**: Use the trash icon next to file/branch groups to remove multiple comments
4. **Export & Share**: Use "Copy Comments" button in diff view to export all comments for the current comparison

## Architecture Overview

Difff uses a sophisticated dual-panel architecture optimized for git diff workflows:

### Core Components

- **Extension Host** (`extension.ts`): Coordinates all functionality and manages VS Code integration
- **Git Service** (`gitService.ts`): Handles all git operations using the `simple-git` library
- **Diff Explorer** (`diffExplorer.ts`): Manages the tree view with mode selectors and file navigation
- **Comment System**:
  - **Comment Service** (`commentService.ts`): Manages comment storage, CRUD operations, and persistence
  - **Comment Explorer** (`commentExplorer.ts`): Provides the comment management UI panel
- **Webview Provider** (`webviewProvider.ts`): Generates GitHub-style HTML for diff rendering

### Dual-Panel Interface

**Git Diff Explorer Panel**:

- Mode selection (Branch Comparison vs Working Directory)
- Branch/reference selectors (in Branch Comparison mode)
- Changed files tree with modification counts
- Toolbar with refresh and compare actions

**Comments Panel**:

- Hierarchical view of all comments grouped by file/context
- Jump-to-comment navigation
- Batch comment management with delete operations
- Refresh control for comment synchronization

### Operation Modes

**Branch Comparison Mode**:

- Compares any two git references (branches, tags, commits)
- Shows diff between the selected base and compare references
- Supports full git reference history including recent commits

**Working Directory Mode**:

- Shows staged and unstaged changes vs HEAD
- Auto-refreshes as files are modified
- Simpler workflow for reviewing current work

### Data Flow

1. User selects mode and references through the tree view
2. Git Service fetches diff data using simple-git
3. Webview Provider generates GitHub-style HTML with diff rendering
4. Comment Service overlays any existing comments for the current context
5. User interactions (comments, navigation) flow back through message passing
6. All comment data persists in VS Code workspace storage
